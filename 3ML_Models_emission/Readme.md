Project Title: Predictive Analysis of Atmospheric Emissions Using Machine Learning

Description:
This project, titled "Developing Machine Learning Models for Predicting Atmospheric Emissions," focuses on analysing London's atmospheric emissions using the 
London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) data 2013. The core objective is to derive insights into emissions patterns and predict future scenarios. 
The project employs three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), each chosen for their specific strengths 
in handling large datasets and predicting complex outcomes.

Key features of the project include:

Data preprocessing and cleaning, ensuring integrity and minimising bias.
Application of Linear Regression for forecasting future emissions, considering factors like population growth and vehicle sales.
Utilisation of Random Forest for its robustness against data irregularities and ability to process large datasets with multiple input features.
Implementing KNN for its effectiveness in classifying data points based on proximity and similarity.
The project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques and addresses the challenges and refinements needed for accurate prediction 
in environmental data analysis. Through this study, we provide a comprehensive view of the potential impact of vehicle emissions, offering 
a foundation for policy-making and urban planning initiatives.
