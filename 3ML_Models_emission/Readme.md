# Predictive Analysis of Atmospheric Emissions Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a detailed project focused on predicting atmospheric emissions in London using the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) data from 2013. The project employs three distinct machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), each providing unique insights and predictive capabilities. 

Key aspects:
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning for optimal model performance.
- Linear Regression for emissions forecasting based on population growth and vehicle sales.
- Random Forest for its robustness and ability to process large datasets with multiple input features.
- KNN for its efficacy in classifying data points by proximity and similarity.

The project aims to provide valuable insights for policy-making and urban planning by predicting future emission scenarios and understanding the impact of various factors on environmental quality.
