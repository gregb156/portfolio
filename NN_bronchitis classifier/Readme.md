# Deep Learning for Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Rays

This repository features a project on developing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for the binary classification of pneumonia and normal chest X-rays. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, the project involves preprocessing, architecture design, hyperparameter optimisation, and model assessment.

Key Highlights:
- Development and comparison of various CNN models for accurate medical diagnosis.
- Implementation of Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization to enhance model performance.
- Focus on achieving high accuracy and minimising loss in model predictions.
- Thorough evaluation of the models using metrics like accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

This work aims to advance medical image analysis by providing a robust approach to pneumonia detection, offering a foundation for future research and potential clinical application.
